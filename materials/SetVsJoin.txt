Here's the code from the previous Activity:

proc sql;
select *
    from sq.salesemail
intersect corr
select *
    from sq.salesphone;
quit;
You can use an INNER JOIN to produce identical results. This example uses an inner join to find all matches of the two tables. The DISTINCT keyword removes any duplicate rows, resulting in the same result as the INTERSECT set operator.

proc sql;
select distinct e.CustomerID
    from sq.salesemail as e inner join
         sq.salesphone as p
    on e.CustomerID = p.CustomerID;
quit;
